## Important 
If you look at my commit history they may seem to be coded as if this code was copied, it was, it was but I had to recopy my own code. I finished this project and recorded a SnapChat video of my code and of me playing the game and saved it and sent it to a friend. After this I went to my terminal to make a commit (at this time i was not using Github) and realized I was working on a 'detatched HEAD' I looked up how to reattatch the HEAD and I ended up losiing about 85% of my code and I was devistated, I searched for the commit for hours, looked up how to get it back and I could not figure it out. Thankfully I had that recording, so I started a new project, this time using Github, and all I had to do was watch my recording that I sent to a friend and the only thing left was to restyle my CSS and HTML.  

## About

This game is project 2 of the Udacity Grow With Google Web Developer Scholarship, the game is ment to display material learned thusfar throughout the course including click events and various types of functions.

## Intstructions
The game is very simple, to start the game click on a card and the timer will start, your moves are counted towards your stars, the less moves the better. Match all of the cards in under 16 moves to get three stars. 

## Future
